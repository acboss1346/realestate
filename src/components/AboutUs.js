            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
                The origins of Trippy drawings trace back to the 1940s when Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Hofmann was researching derivatives of lysergic acid to create a circulatory and respiratory stimulant with no negative side effects on the uterus. The result? LSD. After creating the drug, he began experimenting with it and soon discovered its powerful psychedelic effects.
